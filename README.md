Prometheus Windows Exporter Installer - an installer that will install the most recent version windows_exporter, make a custom config file for it to watch only certain process or services. This is a work inprogress and the "first" C# application I have written.

This is build in WinForms with .NET 4.8 and uses Prometheus windows_exporter to install a metrics output to windows that can be used in Prometheus or looked at using localhost:9182/metrics. More specificiations to come.
